# GGUF Models

audio.cpp can load audio.cpp-native GGUF checkpoints for model families that have a
package spec. GGUF is a container for tensors and sidecar files; it is not a universal
adapter for arbitrary llama.cpp or whisper.cpp GGUF files. The tensor names and embedded
metadata still have to match the selected `--family`.

Package specs are maintained as `model_specs/*.json`. New GGUFs contain the selected
spec in `audiocpp.model_spec.*` metadata, so a standalone GGUF does not depend on a
`model_specs` directory or on the binary having that family compiled into its spec
catalog.

Runtime resolution is deterministic:

```text
explicit --model-spec-override
              |
              v
package spec embedded in the selected GGUF
              |
              v
compiled catalog (AUDIOCPP_DEPLOYMENT_BUILD=ON)
              |
              v
external model_specs/<family>.json discovery
```

An explicit override is useful for testing a modified layout without rebuilding or
reconverting:

```bash
audiocpp_cli --inspect --family qwen3_asr --model /path/to/model.gguf \
  --model-spec-override /path/to/qwen3_asr.json
```

The override may also be a directory containing `<family>.json`. The server supports
the same command-line option and a `model_spec_override` field either at the top level
or inside an individual model entry. A per-model field takes precedence over the
server-wide value.

Additional lower-bit checks:

| `vibevoice_asr_streaming` | `q4_k` | Pass (quick CUDA check; transcript stays usable and matches the BF16 wording class) |
| `voxtral_realtime` | `q4_k` | Pass (quick CUDA check; transcripts match Q8 except one capitalization-only difference) |

Q8 packaging notes:

- `chatterbox` Q8 is intentionally mixed type. Graph-sensitive scalar, norm,
  bias, and side tensors stay in non-Q8 types while matmul-compatible weights
  are quantized.
- `pocket_tts` Q8 keeps the four `flow_lm.flow_net.time_embed.*.mlp.{0,2}.weight`
  tensors in Q8 in addition to the default converter selection. `conditioner.embed`,
  `cond_embed`, and Mimi conv tensors are not forced to Q8 because tested outputs
  drifted or the current conv path casts quantized conv weights back to F32.
- `dots_tts` Q8 keeps the vocoder in 16-bit storage and folds vocoder
  weight-norm conv tensors at conversion time. Use
  `--keep-type 'vocoder/*=f16' --fold-weight-norm 'vocoder/*'` for both SOAR
  and MeanFlow Q8 conversion so the flow/LLM path is quantized while the
  vocoder stays in the tested dtype with direct conv weights.
- `qwen3_tts` Q8 should keep speaker-sensitive components in their original
  16-bit type. The tested Base Q8 package quantizes the talker transformer and
  projections, talker code-predictor heads, and speech-tokenizer encoder/decoder
  projection or linear weights, while leaving the speaker encoder, lookup, and
  codebook-sensitive tensors unquantized. Quantizing those speaker-side tensors
  can produce long-form quality problems such as large silence.
- `supertonic` F16 is intentionally mixed type. Keep duration predictor,
  vocoder, non-weight tensors, embeddings, codebook tensors, and norm tensors in
  F32; convert only compatible projection weights to F16. Supertonic Q8 is not
  currently supported: broader Q8 packages still hit CUDA Q8 copy/layout
  blockers in text/vector graph paths, so the Q8 blocker is not fully solved.
- `voxtral_realtime` also has a tested `q4_k` package. In a quick CUDA path
  check it was smaller and faster than Q8_0, while transcript output matched
  Q8_0 except for one capitalization-only difference.
- `vibevoice_asr_streaming` also has a tested `q4_k` package. In a quick CUDA
  check, BF16 and Q4_K produced the same transcript wording on the validation
  clip; Q8_0 produced the same sentence with minor wording drift.

## Build The Converter

```bash
cmake --build build/debug --parallel --target audiocpp_gguf
```

Normal builds leave `AUDIOCPP_DEPLOYMENT_BUILD` off. Enable it when one binary must also
carry fallback specs for safetensors packages or legacy GGUFs that predate embedded spec
metadata:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/deploy -DAUDIOCPP_DEPLOYMENT_BUILD=ON
cmake --build build/deploy --parallel
```

`audiocpp_gguf` always carries the conversion catalog. This is separate from the optional
CLI/server deployment catalog, and keeps a copied converter executable usable when the
source checkout and its `model_specs` directory are not present.

Check the converter interface:

```bash
audiocpp_gguf --help
```

Current shape:

```bash
audiocpp_gguf --input [namespace=]<weights> [--input namespace=<weights> ...] \
  --output <weights.gguf> \
  --type <orig|f16|bf16|q8_0|q2_k|q3_k|q4_k|q5_k|q6_k> \
  [--family <family>] \
  [--model-spec <json-or-directory>] \
  [--root <model-dir>] \
  [--sidecar <source>=<destination>] \
  [--bnb-nf4-type q8_0] \
  [--exclude-prefix <logical-prefix>] \
  [--keep-type <tensor-prefix>*=<type>] \
  [--overwrite] \
  [--no-sidecars] \
  [--allow-missing-model-spec]

audiocpp_gguf --inspect <model.gguf>
```

## Convert A Single Tensor Source

Standalone conversion is the default. The converter embeds non-weight files recursively
from the first tensor source's directory, or from `--root` when it is supplied. Use
`--root` when the model has tokenizer, config, processor, or other non-weight files in
a different model root. It also finds, validates, and embeds the package spec. Conversion
fails before writing when the tensor namespaces or required sidecars do not match that
spec.

```bash
audiocpp_gguf \
  --input /path/to/model/model.safetensors \
  --root /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-gguf/model.gguf \
  --type f16 \
  --overwrite
```

Safetensors shard indexes are accepted directly:

```bash
audiocpp_gguf \
  --input /path/to/model/model.safetensors.index.json \
  --root /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-gguf/model.gguf \
  --type q8_0 \
  --overwrite
```

## Convert A Multi-Component Model

Use repeated namespaced `--input` entries when a model has multiple tensor components.
The namespace must match the model's package spec.

```bash
audiocpp_gguf \
  --input model_weights=/path/to/model/model.safetensors \
  --input codec_weights=/path/to/model/codec/model.safetensors \
  --root /path/to/model \
  --output /path/to/model-gguf/model.gguf \
  --type f16 \
  --overwrite
```

## Convert BitsAndBytes NF4 Sources

Some upstream packages store tensors as BitsAndBytes NF4 data in U8 safetensors plus
helper tensors. Use `--bnb-nf4-type q8_0` for these sources. The converter decodes the
NF4 payload, uses the quant-state shape for GGUF metadata, re-quantizes the decoded
weights to GGML Q8_0, and skips the BNB helper tensors from the output.

`--keep-type` only overrides the GGUF output type for normal tensors. It does not decode
raw BNB NF4 U8 tensors by itself.

Use `--exclude-prefix <logical-prefix>` to omit a tensor subtree that the audio.cpp model
does not load, for example an unused vision tower in a shared language-model checkpoint.

```bash
audiocpp_gguf \
  --input audio=models/Dramabox/dramabox-audio-components.safetensors \
  --input dit=models/Dramabox/dramabox-dit-v1.safetensors \
  --input gemma=models/gemma-3-12b-it-bnb-4bit/model.safetensors.index.json \
  --input silence=models/Dramabox/assets/silence_latent_frame.safetensors \
  --root build/debug/dramabox_gguf_sidecars_spec \
  --output models/Dramabox-GGUF/dramabox-q8_0.gguf \
  --type q8_0 \
  --bnb-nf4-type q8_0 \
  --exclude-prefix gemma/vision_tower \
  --family dramabox \
  --model-spec model_specs/dramabox.json \
  --overwrite
```

## Add External Sidecars

Use `--sidecar <source>=<destination>` when a runtime file is needed but does not live
under `--root`, or when it should be embedded at a different path inside the GGUF.

```bash
audiocpp_gguf \
  --input /path/to/model/model.safetensors.index.json \
  --root /path/to/model \
  --sidecar /path/to/shared/preprocessor_config.json=preprocessor_config.json \
  --output /path/to/model-gguf/model.gguf \
  --type q8_0 \
  --overwrite
```

If the default pipeline cannot find any sidecars, conversion fails instead of silently
creating a tensor-only file. Supply the correct `--root` and any required external
`--sidecar` mappings. Pass `--no-sidecars` only when you intentionally want a tensor-only
container; place that GGUF and all package-spec-required sidecars together in one model
directory when loading it. `--no-sidecars` does not remove the embedded package spec and
does not disable build-time validation.

## Package Spec Discovery During Conversion

The converter selects the first valid source at the highest available priority:

1. `--model-spec <json-or-directory>` (also accepted as `--model-spec-override`).
2. A spec object, JSON string, or relative path in the model's `config.json`.
3. `model_spec.json` or `model_specs/*.json` below the model root.
4. A discovered `model_specs/*.json` directory from the working directory upward.
5. The converter's bundled source catalog.

Higher-priority inputs are authoritative. If an explicit override, model-config spec, or
local spec is present but does not match the tensor namespaces and required files, the
converter reports that error instead of silently falling back to a lower-priority layout.

Use `--family <family>` to disambiguate models whose configuration does not identify the
audio.cpp family. A model configuration can declare it directly:

```json
{
  "audiocpp_family": "qwen3_asr",
  "audiocpp_model_spec": "model_spec.json"
}
```

`audiocpp_model_spec` may instead be a JSON string or a path relative to `config.json`.
The nested forms `audiocpp.family`, `audiocpp.model_spec`, and
`audiocpp.package_spec` are also accepted. The converter additionally recognizes known
upstream `model_type` values.

`--allow-missing-model-spec` is an explicit escape hatch for creating a tensor archive
that audio.cpp is not expected to load as a model. It is not recommended for deployable
GGUFs.

## Inspect And Run

Inspect the finished package before using it:

```bash
audiocpp_gguf --inspect /path/to/model-gguf/model.gguf
```

If the GGUF embeds all required sidecars, it can be passed directly as `--model`:

```bash
audiocpp_cli --task asr --family qwen3_asr --model /path/to/model-gguf/model.gguf --backend cuda --audio speech.wav
```

A directory is also accepted by supported package specs. It resolves to `model.gguf` when that
name is present, otherwise to the single `*.gguf` inside it — so a downloaded package directory
works under its release name without renaming anything:

```bash
audiocpp_cli --task tts --family qwen3_tts --model /path/to/model-gguf --backend cuda --text "Hello." --out out.wav
audiocpp_cli --task vc --family vevo2 --model models/Vevo2-GGUF --backend cuda --audio source.wav --voice-ref target.wav --out converted.wav
```

A directory holding several GGUFs and no `model.gguf` is ambiguous and is rejected with the
candidates listed; pass one of them directly as `--model`, or keep a single GGUF per directory.

## Type Notes

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `orig` | Preserve the original safetensors storage type where possible. |
| `f16` | Convert eligible tensors to FP16. |
| `bf16` | Convert eligible tensors to BF16. Useful for BF16 source models. |
| `q8_0` | Quantize eligible tensors to Q8_0; unsupported tensors remain in a backend-safe type. |
| `q2_k`/`q3_k`/`q4_k`/`q5_k`/`q6_k` | Lower-bit quantized formats. Treat as experimental per model and backend. |

Quantized GGUF support is model- and route-specific. A model may load successfully but
still drift in length, waveform similarity, or recognized text, so validate the exact
route you plan to ship.
